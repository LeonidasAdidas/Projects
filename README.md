# Minesweeper
Simple version of Minesweeper with 3 difficulties and a highscore system
Made in Java, but it might not be adhere to some OOP standards
Made as a university project
Watch out for potentially loud music

# ImgToAscii
Website hosted by a Python server
Sends back an input image as ASCII Art to the user
Server retrieves the image in a not so nice way
Image to ASCII conversion is done by a short Rust program
It is indeed very slow because I did not prioritize efficiency

# ChatApp
Application that can work as a chat system
Server can serve multiple clients simultaneously
Client can talk with multiple different people
Login is just based on a username and messages are not encrypted
It has the features of normal chat apps except for groups (we plan to add this)
Stores message history and user history in a database
